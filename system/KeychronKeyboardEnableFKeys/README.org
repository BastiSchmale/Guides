* Description

Both in Bluetooth and Wired modes, Keychron Keyboards on Linux use the hid_apple driver in Windows/Android mode. By default, this driver uses the F-keys as multimedia shortcuts. Therefore, to get the expected F1 through F12 keys, you have to press Fn + the key of choice. In order to make usual F-Key work, you need to modify the fnmode parameter for the hid_apple kernel module. In this guide you will learn how to fix it.

* Guide

The Keychron keyboard has two modes: Windows/Android and macOS. Unfortunately, both modes don't work properly out of the box on Linux like Ubuntu, which I have been tested.

In order to change the keychron driver parameter for function keys, create a config file ~hid_apple~:

#+begin_src sh :noeval
sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf
#+end_src

Then, you have to set the parameter ~fnmode~ to =2= by inserting the following line:

#+begin_src example
options hid_apple fnmode=2
#+end_src

The parameter ~fnmode~ can be choosen from 0 to 2:

| Parameter | Function   | Description                                              |
|-----------+------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
|         0 | disabled   | Disable the 'fn' key.                                    |
|           |            | Pressing 'fn'+'F8' will behave like you only press 'F8'  |
|         1 | fkeyslast  | Function keys are used as last key.                      |
|           |            | Pressing 'F8' key will act as a special key.             |
|           |            | Pressing 'fn'+'F8' will behave like a F8.                |
|         2 | fkeysfirst | Function keys are used as first key.                     |
|           |            | Pressing 'F8' key will behave like a F8.                 |
|           |            | Pressing 'fn'+'F8' will act as special key (play/pause). |

If ~hid_apple~ is already included you can rebuild your initramfs using the following command:

#+begin_src sh :noeval
sudo update-initramfs -u -k all
#+end_src

After that (even after a reboot), you should be able to use the F-Keys of your Keychron Keyboard as expected.
